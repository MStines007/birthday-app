Today is the Day!

## Description

Today is the Day! is a lightweight rails app that generates a custom list of events, famous births, observed holidays and New York Times headlines which coincide with a particular birthday entered by the user. It's meant to be an easy way to celebrate a birthday or to learn more about the day you were born.
