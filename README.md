Today is the Day!

## Description

Today is the Day! is a lightweight rails app that generates a custom list of events, famous births, observed holidays and New York Times headlines which coincide with a particular birthday entered by the user. It's meant to be an easy way to celebrate a birthday or to learn more about the day you were born.

## Background

Created in 2015 by Skylar Panuska and Matthew Stines at the Flatiron School in New York City.

## Usage

Today is the Day! currently runs locally through a Rails server.

## Future

Going forward we plan to continue refactoring the code, adding features and refining visual styling. Deployment is also in the coming.
